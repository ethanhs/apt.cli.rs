# Rust Tools apt repo

This is a simple apt repo hosting popular Rust tools which you can access at [apt.cli.rs](https://apt.cli.rs).

The plan is to update the repo when these tools make new releases, so you automatically get the latest and greatest (and don't have to manually install `.deb` files).


### Current packages available
